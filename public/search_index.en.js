stated in this post, one of my goals for this year is to make a functioning and testable MVP every two months. Over the past weeks I've been listing potential ideas, and settled on which one would be my first MVP.\n\n\nAnd the winner is... (drums rolling...)\n\nBackstory\nStartups From The Bottom is a newsletter which delivers an \"in-depth, actionable idea and analysis for serious entrepreneurs\" (as it says on their website) to your inbox every day. In reality, every day you get a short email (~5 min. read max) with a startup suggestion in the form of some bullets expanded. This bullets, which are always the same, are: \n\nBackstory: how a problem or pain point was found\nThe Idea: what the solution could be\nDeep dive: how it should be implemented\nValidation: how do they know this should work\nMonetization: how could money be made with the proposed solution\n\nOver the past months they sent several ideas which I definitely thought I could implement myself as side projects to make some extra money. But what I value the most from these emails is that every day, when you read about some cool new app that could be made or some product that the market needs, your brain gets to work and imagination starts flowing. It's a nice and simple way to prevent your brain from stagnating and get it moving.\nThe thing is, I found myself wanting for something more than just an email every day. It is a good starting point for igniting the engine, but how about the follow up stage? What if I came up with a better implementation than what they proposed? I have no way of sharing it with other readers. Or, how can I keep my favorite suggested ideas at hand? If maybe I'd like to create one these, how could I reach for help from the nonexistent community? There are a lot of people out there (supposedly 1200+ readers) that have no way interacting with each other, losing a huge opportunity to create a community centered around the newsletter.\nThe Idea\nSo I decided that my first MVP in 2019 would be a website where all the suggestions from the newsletter would be uploaded, and where people could register and have the ability to:\n\nBookmark their favorite ones for future reference\nComment on ideas, forum-like\n(Maybe) Upvote/Downvote ideas, for the creators of the newsletter to get feedback on what they are sending\n\nImplementing this shouldn't take me more than the two months time frame I have available to finish this first MVP.\nDeep Dive\nThe website would be implemented using Laravel, a PHP framework which I'm already familiar with. It would have an admin panel for managing the site's content. Users would be able to register, bookmark ideas and participate in the forum, and upvote/downvote ideas. The website would be hosted in DigitalOcean, where I already own a droplet where it can be set up.\nValidation\nSeveral colleagues and friends who are also subscribed to the newsletter have the same needs. If you browse through startup or indie forums (like IndieHackers for example), you'll see a lot of posts by people asking for advise on bootstrapping their own business or side project. As the Startups From The Bottom subscriber list is made of people wanting to receive ideas for creating their own hustle, a specialized forum made just for these kind of topics is a natural step for the project.\nMonetization\nGiven the site should have regular visitors (a new idea would be posted every day), I guess money could be made with ads. Another option could be to offer some kind of tiered subscriptions, where paying users get some additional features.\nNext steps\nSome days ago I already got in touch with the Startups From The Bottom team to get their permission to make this site around their newsletter content. They already were, in fact, in the process of building this, but have been struggling with the development. I got to chat with Brian, really nice guy, and are now finishing the details of the agreement.\nSo I now have two months (self imposed deadline, so that I can start with MVP #2) to finish this little but exciting project.\nKeep around to get updates and hear about the implementation process!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/post/2019-challenge-mvp-1-startups-from-the-bottom-newsletter-community/","title":"2019 Challenge: MVP #1 - Startups From The Bottom newsletter community"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/post/2019-personal-challenge-an-mvp-every-two-months/":{"body":"Inspired by posts and stories from the different sources I read daily (like Indiehackers,  Startups from the bottom, The hustle, and others) it's been a while since I wanted to start implementing ideas and test if they were good enough to become a viable product. And what a better date to set as the starting line than the beginning of a new year!\n\nOver the past months, several potential ideas emerged in talks with colleagues and friends, but they never get past the \"that would be a cool thing to do!\" moment and end up getting lost in the shuffle.\n\n\"So worry no more, you promising ideas, this is your lucky year!\"  - Me\n\nMy goal is to have a different testable working MVP every two months next year. Given that I'm a software developer, most (if not all) the things I'll end up building will surely be software related, but I'm not limiting myself to that. I have already defined some stuff that I would like to try, and will be revisiting and updating my list while in the process. As of now, the topics range from project management, to gaming, or social, or office related software.\nThe dynamic will be something like this:\n\nPick up an idea from my list-of-cool-ideas\nDecide what the scope of the MVP should be\nWrite a little introduction post in this blog\nImplement it\nTest / validate it\nTurn it into a marketable product if it has potential - ditch it otherwise\nShare my experience of it's implementation, testing and final decision over here\n\nI believe that two months should be enough time to do this, if the scope is well chosen: I already have a full time job and also some side projects and freelance work. So defining correctly what the MVP should be will be critical for my success.\nBut wait... What's an MVP?\nAs defined by The Lean Startup strategy (by Eric Ries):\n\nA minimum viable product (MVP) is the \"version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort\" (similar to a pilot experiment).\n\nDepending on the product, maybe just a spreadsheet with some formulas is enough to validate it's value; maybe it's just a form on a webpage, or a demo video, or some wireframes. The whole purpose of an MVP is to serve as a means to support or reject the \"This idea will work\" hypothesis. The important thing is to capture the essence of the product, and ask the right questions about it's validity.\nStay tuned for news and updates on this challenge's progress.\nAnd happy new year to everyone!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/post/2019-personal-challenge-an-mvp-every-two-months/","title":"2019 Personal Challenge: an MVP every two months"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/post/adding-macros-to-laravel-eloquent-models/":{"body":"It happened to me recently. I was developing the backend for a web application, and this apparently easy and trivial problem resulted to be a complicated one. It was similar to other problems I've dealt with in the past - but the solution was not the same as the one in any of those.\n\nI tried to figure it out on my own for a while, until I gave up and decided to ask my old friend, the almighty and wise Google, if he (or she?) got the answer. It was then when it struck me. I didn't know how to search about the problem I was trying to resolve; I didn't know its name!\n\n\n“Kids, let me tell you about another so called ‘wicked’ guy. He had long hair and some wild ideas, and he didn’t always do what other people thought was right, and that man’s name was . . . I forget. But the point is . . . I forget that, too. Marge, you know who I’m talking about, he used to drive that blue car.”\n\nSo I started asking Google the same questions I was asking myself:\n\nHow to know if there exists a combination of a given set of entities that satisfies a given set of conditions?\nMatching entities with conditions\nAlgorithm to know if every condition in a given set is satisfied by a unique entity from a given set\n\nAnd after every search, I found no answer to my specific problem. As Homer in that Simpsons' episode, I was being too generic and giving no specific directions for the other part (Google in this case) to get where I wanted to get.\nWhat was the problem in question?\nI'll try to describe it briefly.\nGiven a set of people and a set of rules, I needed to know if that group of people could satisfy every one of the rules and, in the solution, each person was assigned to only one of the rules it satisfies.\nPeople were characterized by their age and gender. And each rule had a variable amount of conditions on those properties.\nI also reformulated it in terms of buckets (replacing the rules) and objects (replacing the people). I had to put exactly one object in each bucket. And an object, given its shape (age and gender), could fit or not (it satisfies the rule's conditions) in a bucket. If there is a combination were each object ends up in a bucket, and each bucket has only one object inside, then that group of objects meets the necessary criteria, and a solution exists.\nIn my case, as in the solution sought every people should be assigned to one rule and each rule to only one person, it only makes sense to try to find a solution if the number of elements in each set (people and rules) is the same.\nWhat are names, in essence?\nAs a software developer I'm familiar, and use it periodically, with the concept of unique identifiers.\n\nAlmost everything in the databases area (both relational and non-relational) is based on having a unique identifier to get to a specific resource (a row in a table, or an object in a collection).\nIf you've worked with C (or any other low level language), you know about pointers - those peculiar entities used to reference a precise block in the system memory.\n\nFor those without programming knowledge, there are lot's of examples in everyday life. How do you tell people where you live? A complete address specifies a unique place on Earth. Every cellphone has an exclusive number to reach it. In my country, Argentina, we have the DNI (for National Identity Document, in Spanish), because people's names are not enough to uniquely single out every person.\nWe use this concept constantly. And when we don't know the name of something (understanding by \"name\" the concept of unequivocally identifying an entity), we start to use diverse tools and resources to try to achieve the same level of specificity. We might describe a person by its physical appearance, or by family or friend relationships, or by its job or studies.\nI ended up using this kind of techniques to find the solution to my original dilemma. I was lucky to study at the engineering university, and back then we examined lot's of problems of various kinds and families. From combinatorial or optimization problems, to graph and networks theory. Many times the same problem had multiple solutions by approaching it from different angles or by modeling reality prioritizing another set of properties.\nBecause of all these situations I studied when in college, I knew that the key had to be somewhere in the realm of graph theory or similar, so I limited my search to problems of this kind, hoping to finally come to the solution I was looking for.\nI started asking around to its distant relatives, like the Traveling Salesman Problem and its variations but got no luck with them.\n\n\nthe Traveling Salesman Problem\n\nSome of them pointed me towards another kind of problem, like the Knapsack Problem. It looked familiar at first glance - if my entities were the things to put inside the knapsack, and conditions were some kind of capacity... But none of its mutations gave me what I wanted.\n\n\nthe Knapsack Problem\n\nTransportation problems also got into the mix, and it seemed a promising modeling approach. If every one of my entities was considered as a source, and every condition was considered as a destination with a capacity of 1, and if a solution was found where all sources arrived at a destination.... I was getting closer!\n\n\nthe Transportation Problem\n\nI also dove into the ocean of Network Flow Problems and things were looking good. Very similar situations were solved using this kind of model, so it was a matter of time until I found the guy I was looking for.\n\n\nthe Network Flow Problem\n\nI finally found it\nIt wasn't easy. I knocked on many doors, in far-away-from-each-other neighborhoods, roaming in the universe of combinatorial theory, networks, graphs, algorithms, etc. But in the end I hit the target. The name I was looking for was Maximum Cardinality Matching in Bipartite Graphs. Given a bipartite graph  the goal is to find a matching with as many edges as possible (equivalently: a matching that covers as many vertices as possible). On one set, there were my entities. And on the other, the restrictions or conditions. An edge exists between elements of different sets if the entity satisfies the condition. For my particular problem, if the maximum cardinality of the constructed graph was equal to the number of entities, then a solution can be found where each entity satisfies a different condition.\nLuckily, and for my peace of mind, I was glad to find out that there are multiple algorithms for solving this riddle.\n\n\nthe Maximum Cardinality Matching of Bipartite Graphs problem\n\nOf the many options for dealing with this, I opted for a pretty simple C implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson with DFS algorithm I found on the Internet, which wasn't hard to transcode to PHP. It uses matrices to model graphs and the elements of the matrix represent the existence of edges (a 1 if it exists, a 0 if it doesn't).\n\nCurious fact: the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm actually models the problem as a network and finds the maximal flow of it, showcasing how close these two kinds of problems are.\n\nAfterthought\nIt was a pretty funny ride, though not the most time-efficient business. If I had known the proper name of the problem beforehand, I would have saved a lot of time and gone directly to the solution. On the other hand, I have now made many new contacts in the world of algorithmic problems - valuable contacts I can reach out the next time I need to find someone I don't yet know.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/post/adding-macros-to-laravel-eloquent-models/","title":"Adding macros to Laravel Elonquent models"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/post/how-i-setup-my-own-mail-server-in-digitalocean-and-almost-fail-at-the-very-last-step/":{"body":"\nTL;DR, Fully functional mail server with web client configured with Docker in DigitalOcean, using Mailgun as a relay server\n\nDon't feel like reading? Check out the Github repo here!\n\n(This is not intended to be a super detailed step by step guide to setting your own mailserver, but to share my own experience with this project.)\nThere comes a time for every little project when a domain name for it's website has to be chosen. And after that, it's time to setup your nice and unique email account with the shiny new domain, right?\nSetting up a landing page with a pretty and responsive design is really easy nowadays, with a lot of templates to chose from if design is not your thing. Firing up a virtual machine in any of the popular hosting services and configuring the DNS records is straight forward.\nBut when wanting to implement mailing with your own domain, lot's of options suddenly appear, each with it's benefits and drawbacks, different unique offerings, pricing, etc... Postfix, Sendmail, Sendgrid, Mailgun, your own SMTP, third party options, APIs, mailing as a service, web clients. How to pick what's best for you?\nLuckily for me, as a developer myself, the choice was really easy! Don't pay for it.. Implement it! So out in the quest for the easiest and most feature-packed solution I was. Having used Docker for some time in the web development and server setup space, I knew there had to be a pre-baked solution for my situation. After some digging, I came across an open source project that claimed to be what I was looking for. As they put it on their website:\n\nMailu is a simple yet full-featured mail server as a set of Docker images. It is free software (both as in free beer and as in free speech), open to suggestions and external contributions. The project aims at providing people with an easily setup, easily maintained and full-featured mail server while not shipping proprietary software nor unrelated features often found in popular groupware.\n\nSo, the only thing left was to get a server within the internet's reach where to put this Docker containers to work and start sending mails from my own server. I've used DigitalOcean to host other web projects in the past, with low prices and reasonably good performance and support. So I spun up the most basic standard droplet for $5/month, and on I went to configure and tie everything up.\nFirst, NGINX as a reverse proxy\nThe default and easy way to setup Mailu on your server binds all the necessary ports of the host machine directly into the dockerized services. This was an issue for me, as I wanted to also host some websites on the same server. So I was forced into either using some unconventional ports and tinkering with more configuration or putting a reverse proxy as the gatekeeper to my server.\nI've done this before, using this awesome dockerized NGINX reverse proxy. I also used the Letsencrypt NGINX proxy companion for automatic SSL certificates creation and renewal. Both are really easy to set up with a docker-compose.yml file. You can find the configuration I used on my github.\nWhen you run the containers, with docker-compose up -d (to leave the containers running in detached mode, in the background), it binds ports 80 and 443 (standard HTTP and HTTPS ports) to the NGINX reverse proxy container, which then does it's magic.\nOnce I had that running, I can fire up other containers with some special environment variables so that they automagically \"register\" themselves to the reverse proxy. The ones I used were VIRTUAL_HOST, LETSENCRYPT_HOST and LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL.\nInitial DNS configuration\nWith the web server listening on ports 80 and 443 on my DigitalOcean droplet, now we have to configure the DNS records so that web traffic reaches our VM.\nDoing this is pretty straight forward:\n\nPoint to DigitalOcean nameservers from your domain registrar (quick guide). Basically, just set up ns1.digitalocean.com, ns2.digitalocean.com, ns3.digitalocean.com as the name servers for your domain.\nSetup your domain inside DigitalOcean to direct to your droplet in your DO panel, registering your domain and creating an A record ponting to your droplet's IP.\n\nOnce this is done, and the DNS configuration propagates (may take up to some hours) you should be able to open your domain on the browser and see an NGINX error page. This is fine, and means that you are now reaching your VM through the web!\nThis means everything is working fine so far\nRunning Mailu\nGetting all the Mailu containers running is simple. Copy their docker-compose.yml and .env files from their documentation, configure all the environment variables, and fire them up. It’s tunning these environment variables which can be a little tricky. Here are the tricky ones I had to set up.\n# /root/mailu/.env\n\nTLS_FLAVOR=mail\n\nADMIN=true\n\nRELAYNETS=172.18.0.0/16 # Docker's subnet were the containers are running\nRELAYHOST=[smtp.mailgun.org]:587\nRELAY_LOGIN=postmaster@your-domain.com\nRELAY_PASSWORD=yourSecretKey # Get it from mailgun's panel\n\nAll the  RELAY stuff is just necessary for the last step, when I set up Mailgun as a relay server for mail sending. If you decide to host this in another cloud provider, it may not be necessary. The other important variable is TLS_FLAVOR. This, in addition to other configuration in the docker-compose.yml file, sets up the necessary certificates.\nThe other important bits of configuration are in the docker-compose.yml file. This is pretty much the default one, except for the port binding in the front service, and some volume mounting. The important bits are here:\n# /root/reverse-proxy/docker-compose.yml\n\nversion: '2'\n\nservices:\n  front:\n    image: mailu/nginx:$VERSION\n    container_name: mailu_front\n    restart: always\n    env_file: .env\n    ports:\n    - \"110:110\"\n    - \"143:143\"\n    - \"993:993\"\n    - \"995:995\"\n    - \"25:25\"\n    - \"465:465\"\n    - \"587:587\"\n    expose:\n      - \"80\"\n      - \"443\"\n    volumes:\n      - /root/reverse-proxy/certs/mail.your-domain.com/key.pem:/certs/key.pem\n      - /root/reverse-proxy/certs/mail.your-domain.com/fullchain.pem:/certs/cert.pem\n      - /root/reverse-proxy/certs/mail.your-domain.com/dhparam.pem:/certs/dhparam.pem\n    environment:\n      - VIRTUAL_HOST=mail.your-domain.com\n      - LETSENCRYPT_HOST=mail.your-domain.com\n      - LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=your@email.com\n    networks:\n      - default\n\n...\n\nnetworks:\n  default:\n    external:\n      name: reverse-proxy_default\n\nThe volume mounting configuration is really important. Here, I'm sharing the certificates that were automatically generated by the Letsencrypt NGINX proxy companion with the Mailu containers, so that they can use them for encryption configuration.\nIt's also important to attach the front service to the reverse proxy network (in my case, called reverse-proxy_default). Without this, the reverse proxy running in front of all these containers won't be able to route traffic to them.\nUsing Mailgun as relay host\nOnce I got up to this point (without the RELAY variables set up in the .env file for the Mailu containers), I was ready to try my mail server. I was receiving mails perfectly from other accounts (@gmail. com, for example). But my outgoing emails were not sent successfully.\nAfter debugging a little, and inspecting the logs (specifically the logs from the smtp service), I narrowed the problem to this:\nsmtp_1_3d8b20f9756e | postfix/smtp[121]: connect to gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com[172.217.197.27]:25: Operation timed out\nsmtp_1_3d8b20f9756e | postfix/smtp[121]: connect to alt1.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com[2800:3f0:4003:c02::1b]:25: Address not available\nsmtp_1_3d8b20f9756e | postfix/smtp[121]: connect to alt1.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com[172.217.192.26]:25: Operation timed out\nsmtp_1_3d8b20f9756e | postfix/smtp[121]: connect to alt2.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com[74.125.193.27]:25: Operation timed out\nsmtp_1_3d8b20f9756e | postfix/smtp[121]: 4D8BD101050: to=, relay=none, delay=544, delays=454/0.01/90/0, dsn=4.4.1, status=deferred (connect to alt2.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com[74.125.193.27]:25: Operation timed out)\n\nThe emails were being processed but got stuck once the communication with google (in this case) had to take place. I started to suspect of DigitalOcean blocking some ports by default in their droplets, so I wrote them a support ticket, asking if port 25 was blocked for outgoing traffic. This was their answer:\n\nHello,\nThank you for reaching out to us. We're very sorry that you are facing issues with SMTP.\nStopping spam is a constant fight and due to this, your account has restrictions specifically on ports 25, 993, 995 and 465. However, you are be able to send out mail using port 587. You will need to open the port in your firewall.\nWe realize this is inconvenient, but many customers in your position move their mailing activities to a third party service such as SendGrid or similar which processes such mail separately from their droplet. I'm sorry for the frustration but we're not able to lift these port restrictions at this time.\nIn terms of a workaround, here are a few alternatives:\n\nUtilize port 587 for SMTP relay via another mail provider, for example G Suite/Gmail, Mailgun, etc. We have a guide on doing so using Postfix here\nConfigure your app or service to send mail directly using either a SMTP client connection (typically using port 587), or API call via another mail provider such as Sendgrid, Mailgun, Mandrill, etc.\n\nPlease note that with this restriction in place on port 25, mail servers hosted here will be unable to directly relay email to other mail servers, as communication between mail servers typically takes place on port 25.\nWe think the API is the best solution, as it is honestly more scalable and what we would use if we wanted to \"future proof\" the project.\nPlease feel free to reach out to us via this ticket if you have further queries or concerns, we will be around to help you out!\nPlease let us know if you have any additional questions, and have a wonderful day!\n\nLater, I asked them if the block on port 25 was permanent, or if there was a way for me to unblock it. They said it will be blocked forever. So there is no way of sending email directly from my own mail server hosted in DigitalOcean.\nI was not ready to give up on my quest. I've used Mailgun's free tier for sending emails in the past. And, as DigitalOcean's support team recommended, I should be able to use it as a relay host for routing my ougoing emails. The only restriction with the free tier is that you only can send 10.000 emails per month (a lot more of what I'm planning to...). Also, in the free plan, you get a shared IP, which can get into any of the IP blacklists if any other using it starts spamming (it happened to me once, but a simple support ticket in the Mailgun site explaining that the IP they assigned to me was in a blacklist was enough for them to assign me a clean new one :) ).\nI followed the tutorial they pointed me to, and after resolving some errors related to \"relay host login\" (copying and executing the /mailu/relay_conf.sh file in the smtp container), I was able to send emails from my mail server, using Mailgun as a relay host.\nConclusion\nI guess the final result is not the optimal one. I'm limited by Mailgun's free tier mail quota, and using a shared IP for mail sending. I could do the same thing in another provider (not DigitalOcean), where the necessary ports are not blocked, and get a dedicated IP. But, for now, this solution is enough for me. And I learned a little bit more of server and email configuration.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/post/how-i-setup-my-own-mail-server-in-digitalocean-and-almost-fail-at-the-very-last-step/","title":"How I setup my own mail server in DigitalOcean (and almost fail at the very last step)"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/post/lessons-learned-at-my-first-game-jam/":{"body":"A few months ago, me and two fellow indie hackers went to a local game jam, in which the only requirement was to make a game with the motto: “it wasn’t designed for this”.\n\nWe already knew we wanted to make a mobile game (iOS/Android), so we rapidly thought the game mechanics, sketched our game and went on to code it. Since we already had experience with these technologies (and they suited our needs), we decided we were using HTML5 + JavaScript for making the game and then port it to the different platforms (iOS and Android) using Cordova. As a game engine, we used Phaser.io, a pretty simple JavaScript game development framework / engine, which served us really well.\nWe ended up with a game in which you use a clock to waste time (it clearly isn’t designed for that), and by the end of the game jam, we already had published it to the Android Play Store (and a few days later to the Apple App Store).\nHere are some things I learned from this first-time experience in making a game and attending a game jam:\n\nEnjoy the whole ride: if you are spending a whole weekend (in our case) into making a minimum viable product (or, if you can, a finished deliverable), it has to be something you like building. From the very beginning of our game design stage I was already liking the idea of the final product. Even if we weren’t able to finish it in that weekend, I knew I was going to have fun the two days I was spending into thinking, designing and implementing our game.\nUse technologies you feel comfortable with: given the short time you have to think, design and code, it’s not a good idea to learn a whole new stack of technologies in these kind of events. Stick to what you know.\nUse the tools at your disposal: as developers, we all love building our stuff from scratch, having full control over out entire codebase. But sometimes it’s a good idea to trust already established tools to move faster and have a deliverable product with less effort.\nDon’t overthink every choice you make: maybe the way you decided to structure your code isn’t fully scalable. Maybe you could have implemented the sprite system in a more optimized web. Maybe your game isn’t taking full advantage of the tech’s potential. There will be time later to focus on all these things. Right now, you have to consciously oversee these issues, and move forward. You have to move fast.\n\nYou need an MVP: before the game jam ends you need to, at least, have the first iteration of your game working, with full mechanics and playability. It’s important to leave the event with a solid foundation of your game. Having a finished playable and fun prototype will give you future motivation to keep working on it, to optimize all those rough edges you left unpolished, to show your game to other people and ask them what they think of it. If you leave without a working prototype, you’ll probably never engage again with the idea of investing your time into it.\nWe are always looking for some more inputs and traction, after all our relatives and friends have tried it, with pretty much good feedback. Obviously, the game is still not complete, and we have many ideas of things we want to add to it, and bug fixes we have to make, like improving the graphics and sound effects, adding more power ups, etc.\nI’d really appreciate if anyone is willing to try it and give some more feedback. The game is in Spanish (we are from Argentina), but it's definitely not language dependent.\nThe links to the app stores are:\n\niOS: https://itunes.apple.com/ar/app/perder-tiempo/id1437864252?l=en&amp;mt=8\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=como.perder.el.tiempo\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/post/lessons-learned-at-my-first-game-jam/","title":"Lessons learned at my first game jam"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/post/on-the-importance-of-knowing-names-and-maximum-cardinality-matching-in-bipartite-graphs/":{"body":"It happened to me recently.

If there is a combination were each object ends up in a bucket, and each bucket has only one object inside, then that group of objects meets the necessary criteria, and a solution exists.\nIn my case, as in the solution sought every people should be assigned to one rule and each rule to only one person, it only makes sense to try to find a solution if the number of elements in each set (people and rules) is the same.\nWhat are names, in essence?\nAs a software developer I'm familiar, and use it periodically, with the concept of unique identifiers.\n\nAlmost everything in the databases area (both relational and non-relational) is based on having a unique identifier to get to a specific resource (a row in a table, or an object in a collection).\nIf you've worked with C (or any other low level language), you know about pointers - those peculiar entities used to reference a precise block in the system memory.\n\nFor those without programming knowledge, there are lot's of examples in everyday life. How do you tell people where you live? A complete address specifies a unique place on Earth. Every cellphone has an exclusive number to reach it. In my country, Argentina, we have the DNI (for National Identity Document, in Spanish), because people's names are not enough to uniquely single out every person.\nWe use this concept constantly. And when we don't know the name of something (understanding by \"name\" the concept of unequivocally identifying an entity), we start to use diverse tools and resources to try to achieve the same level of specificity. We might describe a person by its physical appearance, or by family or friend relationships, or by its job or studies.\nI ended up using this kind of techniques to find the solution to my original dilemma. I was lucky to study at the engineering university, and back then we examined lot's of problems of various kinds and families. From combinatorial or optimization problems, to graph and networks theory. Many times the same problem had multiple solutions by approaching it from different angles or by modeling reality prioritizing another set of properties.\nBecause of all these situations I studied when in college, I knew that the key had to be somewhere in the realm of graph theory or similar, so I limited my search to problems of this kind, hoping to finally come to the solution I was looking for.\nI started asking around to its distant relatives, like the Traveling Salesman Problem and its variations but got no luck with them.\n\n\nthe Traveling Salesman Problem\n\nSome of them pointed me towards another kind of problem, like the Knapsack Problem. It looked familiar at first glance - if my entities were the things to put inside the knapsack, and conditions were some kind of capacity... But none of its mutations gave me what I wanted.\n\n\nthe Knapsack Problem\n\nTransportation problems also got into the mix, and it seemed a promising modeling approach. If every one of my entities was considered as a source, and every condition was considered as a destination with a capacity of 1, and if a solution was found where all sources arrived at a destination.... I was getting closer!\n\n\nthe Transportation Problem\n\nI also dove into the ocean of Network Flow Problems and things were looking good. Very similar situations were solved using this kind of model, so it was a matter of time until I found the guy I was looking for.\n\n\nthe Network Flow Problem\n\nI finally found it\nIt wasn't easy. I knocked on many doors, in far-away-from-each-other neighborhoods, roaming in the universe of combinatorial theory, networks, graphs, algorithms, etc. But in the end I hit the target. The name I was looking for was Maximum Cardinality Matching in Bipartite Graphs. Given a bipartite graph  the goal is to find a matching with as many edges as possible (equivalently: a matching that covers as many vertices as possible). On one set, there were my entities. And on the other, the restrictions or conditions. An edge exists between elements of different sets if the entity satisfies the condition. For my particular problem, if the maximum cardinality of the constructed graph was equal to the number of entities, then a solution can be found where each entity satisfies a different condition.\nLuckily, and for my peace of mind, I was glad to find out that there are multiple algorithms for solving this riddle.\n\n\nthe Maximum Cardinality Matching of Bipartite Graphs problem\n\nOf the many options for dealing with this, I opted for a pretty simple C implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson with DFS algorithm I found on the Internet, which wasn't hard to transcode to PHP. It uses matrices to model graphs and the elements of the matrix represent the existence of edges (a 1 if it exists, a 0 if it doesn't).\n\nCurious fact: the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm actually models the problem as a network and finds the maximal flow of it, showcasing how close these two kinds of problems are.\n\nAfterthought\nIt was a pretty funny ride, though not the most time-efficient business. If I had known the proper name of the problem beforehand, I would have saved a lot of time and gone directly to the solution. On the other hand, I have now made many new contacts in the world of algorithmic problems - valuable contacts I can reach out the next time I need to find someone I don't yet know.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/post/on-the-importance-of-knowing-names-and-maximum-cardinality-matching-in-bipartite-graphs/","title":"On the importance of knowing names... and Maximum Cardinality Matching in Bipartite Graphs"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/post/2019-challenge-mvp-1-startups-from-the-bottom-newsletter-community/":{"body":354,"title":8},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/post/2019-personal-challenge-an-mvp-every-two-months/":{"body":228,"title":6},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/post/adding-macros-to-laravel-eloquent-models/":{"body":658,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/post/how-i-setup-my-own-mail-server-in-digitalocean-and-almost-fail-at-the-very-last-step/":{"body":1025,"title":8},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/post/lessons-learned-at-my-first-game-jam/":{"body":340,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/post/on-the-importance-of-knowing-names-and-maximum-cardinality-matching-in-bipartite-graphs/":{"body":658,"title":8}},"length":7}};
