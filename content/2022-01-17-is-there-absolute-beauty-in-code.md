The discussion about whether beauty is an objective or subjective property has been a point of conflict in the field of metaphysics for a long time. I tend to lean more towards the objective way of thinking a bit more. How does this apply to code?

# What's the difference between these two points of view?

In short, the "objective band" argues that there is an absolute scale of beauty inherent in objects that does not depend on the appreciation of an observer.

The "subjective band", will argue that beauty does not belong to the object itself, but that it arises from the relationship of the observer with the object; in this way, two different observers might assign different values of beauty to the same object.

# Beauty? Quality? Are they the same?

- used interchangeably

# Diving on the objetive side a bit

## Metrics of code quality
Many attempts have been made to find objetive metrics to analyze code and assign a value of quality to it.
- cyclomatic complexity
- tests code coverage?
- others...

## Simplifying it
- code is not meant for machines to be read; code is meant to be read by other humans
- systems are complex; quality means expressing the system in the simplest way; code beauty lies in its ease of understanding by other people
- "clean code" book reference
